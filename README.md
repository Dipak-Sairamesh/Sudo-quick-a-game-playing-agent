# Sudoku-AI
The problem statement of the final project for Foundations of
Artificial Intelligence seeks to explore an application of AI
on a real-life problem. For the sake of making this interesting,
a sudoku game-playing agent will visually solve puzzles from
a million quizzes Kaggle dataset or by fetching the puzzle
from Sugoku. Exploration combined with knowledge of
search algorithms and constraint satisfaction, in addition to
Python 3.7 and PyCharm IDE are used to accomplish visually
appealing resolutions as well as bringing each step to life.
